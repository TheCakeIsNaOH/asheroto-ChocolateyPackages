This is the repository for my [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) packages.

My profile on Chocolatey: https://community.chocolatey.org/profiles/asheroto

## Updates

Each Wednesday and Saturday, my PowerShell script will automatically update all packages that are out of date and push them to the repository. If you notice a package is out of date and you've waited a few days, please open an [Issue](../../issues) and I'll look into it.

For updating packages, I use [Chocolatey Package Updater](https://github.com/asheroto/Chocolatey-Package-Updater), which is my solution inspired by the now archived [AU](https://github.com/majkinetor/au) repository.

> [!NOTE]
> In this repository, [Chocolatey-Package-Updater.ps1](https://github.com/asheroto/ChocolateyPackages/blob/master/UpdateAll.ps1) is a symbolic link to the [actual script](https://github.com/asheroto/Chocolatey-Package-Updater/blob/main/Chocolatey-Package-Updater.ps1) in the Chocolatey Package Updater repository.
