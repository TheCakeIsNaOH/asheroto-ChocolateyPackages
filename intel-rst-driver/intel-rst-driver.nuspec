### Detailed Description

**Note:** Intel recommends that end users utilize driver updates provided by their system manufacturer/provider or via Windows* Update to eliminate the potential impact caused by loading non-customized drivers. System manufacturers regularly customize Intel generic drivers to meet the needs of their specific system design. In such cases, use of the Intel generic driver update is not recommended.

The SetupRST.exe is the new installer that will install the Intel RST driver and start the process of installing the Intel® Optane™ Memory and Storage Management application from the Microsoft Store*

### Purpose

The Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (Intel® RST) Driver supports the configuration and enabling of multiple features including:

- System acceleration with Intel® Optane™ memory
- Configuration and maintenance of RAID 0/1/5/10
- Intel® VMD support on 11th Gen platforms (See more details [here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000057787/memory-and-storage/intel-optane-memory.html))

**This package deploys the suitable Intel RST driver in alignment with your computer's CPU generation**, as detailed in Intel's [official guidelines](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000091087/technologies/intel-rapid-storage-technology-intel-rst.html).

You can find more information about each driver's version by visiting the Intel RST download page associated with your computer's CPU generation.

- ~~[7th Gen Platforms](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15667/intel-rapid-storage-technology-intel-rst-user-interface-and-driver.html)~~ **Note:** In November 2023 Intel removed the info URL and download URL for the 7th generation driver. This link may be removed in the future.
- [8th and 9th Gen Platforms](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19755/intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver-installation-software-with-intel-optane-memory-8th-and-9th-gen-platforms.html)
- [10th and 11th Gen Platforms](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/19512/intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver-installation-software-with-intel-optane-memory-10th-and-11th-gen-platforms.html) - this package does **not** use this driver for 11th gen platforms per Intel's recommendation and uses the one below instead
- [11th up to 13th Gen Platforms](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/720755/intel-rapid-storage-technology-driver-installation-software-with-intel-optane-memory-11th-and-12th-gen-platforms.html)</description>
