Recover your deleted files quickly and easily with Recuva. Whether it's an accidental deletion or a computer crash, Recuva has you covered.

## Superior file recovery
- Recuva can recover pictures, music, documents, videos, emails or any other file type you've lost. It also supports recovery from any rewriteable media: memory cards, external hard drives, USB sticks and more.

## Recovery from damaged disks
- Unlike most file recovery tools, Recuva can recover files from damaged or newly formatted drives, offering greater flexibility and a higher chance of recovery.

## Deep scan for buried files
- For those hard to find files, Recuva has an advanced deep scan mode that scours your drives to find any traces of files you have deleted.

## Securely delete files
- If you want to ensure a file is gone for good, Recuva's secure overwrite feature uses industry- and military-standard deletion techniques to keep your files erased.
