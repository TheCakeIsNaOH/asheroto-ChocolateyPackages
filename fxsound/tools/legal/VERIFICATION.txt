VERIFICATION
Verification is intended to assist the Chocolatey moderators and community in verifying that this package's contents are trustworthy.

To verify the files using the author's download URL:

1. Please go to the author's download URL
	https://download.fxsound.com/fxsoundlatest
2. NOTE: There may not be a way to download specific versions, as the URL above is the latest version and no apparent old versions are available, although the changelog shows different file versions without a download link
3. Use Get-FileHash -Path <FILE TO VERIFY> to get the file hash value from both the downloaded file (from step 1 above) and the file from the package and compare them
